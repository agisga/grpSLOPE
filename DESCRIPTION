Description: Group SLOPE is a penalized linear regression method that is used
    for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a
    high-dimensional linear model.
    The Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false discovery rate at a
    user-specified level (i.e., control the expected proportion of irrelevant
    among all selected groups of predictors).
